//!
//! `linfa` currently provides sub-packages with the following algorithms:
//!
//!
//! | Name | Purpose | Status | Category |  Notes |
//! | :--- | :--- | :---| :--- | :---|
//! | [clustering](https://docs.rs/linfa-clustering/) | Data clustering | Tested / Benchmarked  | Unsupervised learning | Clustering of unlabeled data; contains K-Means, Gaussian-Mixture-Model and DBSCAN  |
//! | [kernel](https://docs.rs/linfa-kernel/) | Kernel methods for data transformation  | Tested  | Pre-processing | Maps feature vector into higher-dimensional space|
//! | [linear](https://docs.rs/linfa-linear/) | Linear regression | Tested  | Partial fit | Contains Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Generalized Linear Models (GLM) |
//! | [elasticnet](https://docs.rs/linfa-elasticnet/) | Elastic Net | Tested | Supervised learning | Linear regression with elastic net constraints |

//! | [nn](https://docs.rs/linfa-nn/) | Nearest Neighbours & Distances | Tested / Benchmarked | Pre-processing | Spatial index structures and distance functions |
//!
//! We believe that only a significant community effort can nurture, build, and sustain a machine learning ecosystem in Rust - there is no other way forward.
//!
//! If this strikes a chord with you, please take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/issues/7) and get involved!
