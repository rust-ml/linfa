///

/// state and provides therefore no method to predict new data. A typical example are kernel
/// methods.

///

/// in *KMeans* this would be the mean values for each class, or in *SVM* the separating
/// hyperplane. It returns a model, which can be used to predict targets for new data.

/// parameters. If the former model is `None`, then the function acts like `Fit::fit` and
/// initializes the model first.
