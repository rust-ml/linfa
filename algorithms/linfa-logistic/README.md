# Logistic Regression

## The Big Picture

`linfa-logistic` is a crate in the [`linfa`](https://crates.io/crates/linfa) ecosystem, an effort to create a toolkit for classical Machine Learning implemented in pure Rust, akin to Python's `scikit-learn`.

## Current state
`linfa-logistic` provides pure Rust implementations of two-class and multinomial logistic regression models.

Both models accept dense `ndarray` matrices as well as sparse `sprs::CsMat` / `sprs::CsMatView` matrices (CSR or CSC) as input records, for fitting and prediction.

## Examples
There are usage examples in the `examples/` directory.

To run the two-class example, use:
```bash
$ cargo run --example winequality_logistic
```

To run the multinomial example, use:
```bash
$ cargo run --example winequality_multi_logistic
```

To run the sparse example, which classifies TF-IDF text features and fits a 100 000-feature problem without densifying it, use:
```bash
$ cargo run --release --example tfidf_sparse_logistic
```

To measure the memory used by the problems in the `sparse_vs_dense` benchmark, use:
```bash
$ cargo run --release --example sparse_vs_dense_memory
```
