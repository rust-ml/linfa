      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/release-071/">Release 0.7.1</a>
      <span>Published on January 14th, 2025</span>
      <p><p>Linfa's 0.7.1 release mainly consists of fixes to existing algorithms and the overall crate. The Random Projection algorithm has also been added to <code>linfa-reduction</code>.</p></p>

      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/release-061/">Release 0.6.1</a>
      <span>Published on December 03th, 2022</span>
      <p><p>Linfa's 0.6.1 release mainly consists of fixes to existing algorithms and the overall crate. The Isotonic Regression algorithm has also been added to <code>linfa-linear</code>.</p></p>

      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/release-060/">Release 0.6.0</a>
      <span>Published on June 15th, 2022</span>
      <p><p>Linfa's 0.6.0 release removes the mandatory dependency on external BLAS libraries (such as <code>intel-mkl</code>) by using a pure-Rust linear algebra library. It also adds the Naive Multinomial Bayes and Follow The Regularized Leader algorithms. Additionally, the <code>AsTargets</code> trait has been separated into <code>AsSingleTargets</code> and <code>AsMultiTargets</code>.</p></p>

      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/release-051/">Release 0.5.1</a>
      <span>Published on February 28th, 2022</span>
      <p><p>Linfa's 0.5.1 release fixes errors and bugs in the previous release, as well as removing useless trait bounds on the <code>Dataset</code> type. Note that the commits for this release are located in the <code>0-5-1</code> branch of the GitHub repo.</p></p>

      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/release-050/">Release 0.5.0</a>
      <span>Published on October 20th, 2021</span>
      <p><p>Linfa's 0.5.0 release adds initial support for the OPTICS algorithm, multinomials logistic regression, and the family of nearest neighbor algorithms. Furthermore, we have improved documentation and introduced hyperparameter checking to all algorithms.</p></p>

      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/release-031/">Release 0.3.1</a>
      <span>Published on March 11th, 2021</span>
      <p><p>In this release of Linfa the documentation is extended, new examples are added and the functionality of datasets improved. No new algorithms were added.</p></p>

      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/new-website/">New website</a>
      <span>Published on February 27th, 2021</span>
      <p><p>I'm happy to announce that Linfa finally gets its own website. We are currently trying to improve the documentation in various places and a website should serve as a starting point for anyone interested in Linfa.</p></p>

      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/release-030/">Release 0.3.0</a>
      <span>Published on January 21th, 2021</span>
      <p><p>Linfa 0.3.0 concentrates on polishing the existing implementation and adds only three new algorithms to the crowd. A new feature system is introduced, which allows the selection of the BLAS/LAPACK backend in the base-crate. The <code>Dataset</code> interface is polished and follows the <code>ndarray</code> model more closely. The new <code>linfa-datasets</code> crate gives easier access to sample datasets and can be used for testing.</p></p>

      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/release-021/">Release 0.2.1</a>
      <span>Published on November 29th, 2020</span>
      <p><p>Linfa 0.2.1 amends changes to the feature system, which made it impossible to release 0.2.0 on <code>crates.io</code>.</p></p>

  <li>
      <a href="https://rust-ml.github.io/linfa/news/first-release/">Release 0.2.0</a>
      <span>Published on November 26th, 2020</span>
      <p><p>This release of Linfa introduced 9 new implementations and a couple of changes to the APIs. Travis support for FOSS projects was dropped, so we were forced to switch to Github Actions and we introduced a couple of traits to represent different classes of algorithms in a better way.</p></p>
