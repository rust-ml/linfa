//! `linfa-nn` provides Rust implementations of common spatial indexing algorithms, as well as a
//! trait-based interface for performing nearest-neighbour and range queries using these
//! algorithms.
//!
//! ## The big picture
//!
//! `linfa-nn` is a crate in the `linfa` ecosystem, a wider effort to
//! bootstrap a toolkit for classical Machine Learning implemented in pure Rust,
//! kin in spirit to Python's `scikit-learn`.
//!
//! You can find a roadmap (and a selection of good first issues)
//! [here](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/linfa/issues) - contributors are more than welcome!
//!
//! ## Current state
//!
//! Right now `linfa-nn` provides the following algorithms:
//! * [Linear Scan](struct.LinearSearch.html)
//! * [KD Tree](struct.KdTree.html)
//! * [Ball Tree](struct.BallTree.html)
//!
//! The [`CommonNearestNeighbour`](struct.CommonNearestNeighbour) enum should be used to dispatch
//! between all of the above algorithms flexibly.
