# Logistic Regression

## The Big Picture

`linfa-logistic` is a crate in the [`linfa`](https://crates.io/crates/linfa) ecosystem, an effort to create a toolkit for classical Machine Learning implemented in pure Rust, akin to Python's `scikit-learn`.

## Current state
`linfa-logistic` provides pure Rust implementations of two-class and multinomial logistic regression models.

## Examples
There are usage examples in the `examples/` directory.

To run the two-class example, use:
```bash
$ cargo run --example winequality
```

To run the multinomial example, use:
```bash
$ cargo run --example winequality_multi
```
