Linfa aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit to build Machine Learning applications with Rust.

Kin in spirit to Python's `scikit-learn`, it focuses on common preprocessing tasks and classical ML algorithms for your everyday ML tasks.

## Current state

Where does `linfa` stand right now? [Are we learning yet?](http://www.arewelearningyet.com/)

`linfa` currently provides sub-packages with the following algorithms:

We believe that only a significant community effort can nurture, build, and sustain a machine learning ecosystem in Rust - there is no other way forward.

If this strikes a chord with you, please take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/issues/7) and get involved!
