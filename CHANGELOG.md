Version 0.3.1 - 2021-03-11
========================

In this release of Linfa the documentation is extended, new examples are added and the functionality of datasets improved. No new algorithms were added.

The meta-issue [#82](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/issues/82) gives a good overview of the necessary documentation improvements and testing/documentation/examples were considerably extended in this release. 

Further new functionality was added to datasets and multi-target datasets are introduced. Bootstrapping is now possible for features and samples and you can cross-validate your model with k-folding. We polished various bits in the kernel machines and simplified the interface there.

The trait structure of regression metrics are simplified and the silhouette score introduced for easier testing of K-Means and other algorithms.

Changes
-----------
 * improve documentation in all algorithms, various commits
 * add a website to the infrastructure (c8acc785b)
 * add k-folding with and without copying (b0af80546f8)
 * add feature naming and pearson's cross correlation (71989627f)
 * improve ergonomics when handling kernels (1a7982b973)
 * improve TikZ generator in `linfa-trees` (9d71f603bbe)
 * introduce multi-target datasets (b231118629)
 * simplify regression metrics and add cluster metrics (d0363a1fa8ef)
