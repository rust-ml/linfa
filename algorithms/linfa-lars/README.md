# Linear Models

`linfa-lars` aims to provide pure Rust implementations of popular least-angle regression algorithms. 

## The Big Picture

`linfa-lars` is a crate in the [`linfa`](https://crates.io/crates/linfa) ecosystem, an effort to create a toolkit for classical Machine Learning implemented in pure Rust, akin to Python's `scikit-learn`.

## Current state

`linfa-lars` currently provides an implementation of the following regression algorithms: 
-
